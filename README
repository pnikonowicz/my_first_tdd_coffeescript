type the following in your console to get started:
1) guard    
2) rake jasmine

you run the tests by just pointing your browser to localhost:8888. guard will take care of the coffeescript compliation. if this is your first time installing the app type a / and hit enter inside the guard window


<h1>NOTES</h1>
this is helpful if your test source files are not being found. 
CS compiles objects into a safe namespace that isn't accessed in an obvious way.

With Jasmin, You cannot put your source files anywhere outside of the public namespace. 
i hear there is an update to fix this but it's not in the current version
